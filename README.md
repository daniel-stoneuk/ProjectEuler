# Project Euler Tasks 1 - 14

Here I have compiled my solutions for [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) tasks 1 to 14.

> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

I completed these challenges in a number of Computer Science lessons, and explained my solutions in Google Slides document which you can view here:
